# Tree-Census-in-New-York
Created a Tableau dashboard to analyze the street tree survey conducted in 2015 and 2016. The analysis aim to give us insights about the health of the trees, species that are being impacted and find a solution to protect and improve it.The dataset has data about species, the width of the trees and stumps, status of the trees, issues, wellbeing of the trees, in case they are situated on-curb/off-curb and substantially more. In this project I analyzed the health status of the trees, the factors that are affecting treeâ€™s growth and health and is there a need to change the protection plan and use more guards around the street trees. Also made a street view of the trees which helps in understanding the tree status in an expansive range wherein we can get insights about the exact location of trees and their health status.
